# Payment diagnosis and implementation plan

## Scope

Repair customer and partner payment journeys while preserving the current design, records, staff access and **existing Lovable Cloud backend**. No second database or backend will be enabled. This is inspection and planning only: no source, database, storage or payment settings were changed.

## Concrete inspection findings

### 1. Customer UPI selection is a preference, not a payment action — confirmed

- `src/components/site/BookingForm.tsx:49–56, 76–94, 253–260`: selecting UPI only changes `paymentChoice`; submission inserts a lesson enquiry. Neither action opens a payment app or checkout.
- `src/routes/book.tsx:63–70`: `LessonPayment` is separate from the booking form in the adjacent column. The components do not share booking identity, amount or payment state.
- `src/components/site/LessonPayment.tsx:7–18, 55–63`: the supplied recipient and QR exist. A `upi://pay` link is rendered **only after entering a positive confirmed amount**. The QR itself is static and not linked to a booking or payment confirmation service.
- Read-only browser check at `/book`: selecting UPI left the URL unchanged; QR loaded successfully, with natural width 1019; there were no page errors. Before entering an amount there were zero UPI links. Entering ₹500 produced the correct recipient link with `am=500.00`.
- On a 390px-wide mobile screen, the QR began about 1,930px below the page top. It is easy to miss below the form. A missing QR asset was **not** reproduced locally; published-site rendering and real-device app launch still require testing.
- A generic UPI link needs a compatible installed mobile app and a deliberate tap. It cannot reliably open a payment app on desktop or establish payment success.

**Diagnosis:** disconnected controls and payment placement, not a failed payment gateway. No fixed learner advance or exact payable course amount can safely be inferred from the published price ranges.

### 2. Partner “upload completed” indication does not mean upload completed — confirmed

- `src/routes/_authenticated/partner-apply.tsx:164–175, 324–335`: selecting a file only stores a browser `File` in state. The tick beside its name is shown immediately; nothing has been uploaded yet.
- `:177–249`: final submission creates an application, then uploads each document and inserts each document row **sequentially**. Up to eight files, each up to 10 MB, share one loading spinner. There is no per-file progress, app-controlled operation deadline, cancellation or resumable submission.
- `:245–250` has `catch` and `finally`, so the spinner should clear when requests settle. It can remain active while a request stays pending. Slow uploads are a credible cause, but the exact failing request behind the reported endless spinner is **not yet proven**.
- `:184–225` creates a new application before uploads. A later failure leaves a partially saved application; retrying starts a fresh application and new timestamped file paths. The database has no application submission-idempotency constraint or unique `(application_id, doc_type)` constraint.
- Only the last step is revalidated on submit (`:178`); the earlier steps and full document set need final validation again.
- `src/lib/partner.ts:13–20` still contains partner payment placeholders. `PaymentBox` (`partner-apply.tsx:393–401`) displays contact instructions, not a payment selector, QR, app link or gateway.
- `src/routes/_authenticated/partner-dashboard.tsx:37–58`: replacement uploads create additional document rows; one `busy` flag covers every operation. `sendReference` lacks `try/finally` for thrown failures and does not confirm an updated row was returned. The reference box is shown for some application states that the update policy does not permit editing.

**Diagnosis:** the current page can look finished uploading before uploading starts; final submission conflates saving and uploading. There is no gateway loading state in this source. Reproduce the reported hang with a partner session and capture the specific stalled request before attributing it to storage, authentication or payment.

### 3. Existing backend and storage — checked live

- Lovable Cloud is active. The eight public application tables all have RLS enabled; no dedicated gateway payment/order/event table exists. Existing booking/application columns contain no Razorpay order or payment identifiers.
- Lesson enquiries permit public inserts but staff-only reads/updates through policies. Partner applications/documents use owner and staff policies. Effective table privileges exist for the relevant roles; this is **not a missing-GRANT diagnosis**. Some table privileges are broader than the policies, but RLS still governs access.
- `partner-documents` is private, with a 10,485,760-byte per-file limit. Owner-folder upload/read/delete policies and staff read policies exist. **The bucket MIME allowlist is currently unset**; file format checks are only performed by the page before upload.
- Aggregate records: one partner application is `Payment Received / Paid`, with seven document rows and seven stored objects. Three lesson records select UPI: two are `Paid`, one `Unpaid`. These existing statuses do not prove gateway payment; preserve them as legacy/manual records rather than retroactively attaching gateway evidence.
- Live partner triggers prohibit non-staff changes to payment verification, ownership and approval. Approval requires `Verified` payment, vehicle inspection and verified RC, insurance, PUC, licence, front/rear photos. A gateway service write needs a deliberately authorized path compatible with these triggers; using an admin client alone is not sufficient.
- `src/start.ts:24–30` already supplies CSRF protection for server functions and bearer attachment. Preserve both.
- Source search found no Razorpay integration, checkout script, order creation or webhook handlers. `Operations.tsx:52, 89` supports manual staff payment updates and currently states that no online charge has been processed.
- No preview telemetry logs were available in this sandbox. Partner submission was not executed, and no financial or application records were created for this inspection.

## Proposed fixes

### Phase 1 — Correct the current journeys without waiting for a gateway

1. **Customer booking:** retain “payment preference”, but make selecting UPI reveal a clearly reachable payment section beside/below the choice. Keep the existing QR, recipient and confirmed-amount input; include the same payment section after successful booking. Opening UPI must be an explicit tap, never an automatic redirect during saving. Keep Cash / pay-after-confirmation available and show no paid state from a scan or app launch.
2. **Partner submission:** save one owned draft/application identifier and reuse it across retries. Upload during the document step, and distinguish “selected”, “uploading”, “saved” and “failed” per file. Use bounded concurrency, e.g. two uploads at a time, real cancellation where supported, operation deadlines and retry only failed files. A timeout must first reconcile whether a write completed; it must not blindly repeat a write.
3. Persist upload metadata only after storage confirms success. Reconcile orphan files/metadata after uncertain responses. Resume the same application after reload; do not persist bank details or private documents in browser storage. Add explicit document version/replacement handling that invalidates the relevant verification and cannot let an obsolete verified copy satisfy approval.
4. Revalidate all five steps and required saved documents before finalization. Show “Application saved; these files still need uploading” on partial failure. Use separate operation states and `try/catch/finally` for upload, submission and reference sending. Confirm reference updates affected a row; distinguish expired login, denied status and network failure.
5. Enforce JPG/PNG/PDF and 10 MB in storage configuration as well as the UI; validate allowed document types and ownership when saving metadata. Preserve private access and short-lived signed document links.
6. Do not reuse the learner UPI recipient for the partner deposit without owner authorization. Until Razorpay is ready or verified partner instructions are supplied, show an honest “Payment not configured” state rather than a payment spinner.

### Phase 2 — Shared secure Razorpay payment service

**Recommendation:** Razorpay Standard Checkout for both journeys. Use UPI Intent / QR through checkout, with cards and netbanking where enabled. Do not build a new UPI Collect/VPA-entry flow; Razorpay documents its deprecation for most users from 28 February 2026.

#### Technical design

- Add `src/lib/payments.functions.ts` for typed app calls and server-only helpers for REST requests, validation and signatures. Use TanStack server functions, not a new backend or Edge Functions. Access secrets inside handlers; use fetch and Web Crypto-compatible HMAC verification.
- Add additive migrations to the **same** database for `payment_attempts` and `payment_webhook_events`. Attempts link to exactly one existing lesson booking or partner application, with purpose, INR amount in paise, quote/version, provider order/payment IDs, pending/captured/failed/refunded state, timestamps and local idempotency key. Unique provider IDs/event IDs prevent duplicate application of payments. Grants must precede RLS/policies for every new public table.
- Partner operations verify the signed-in owner through existing middleware and RLS. Public learner booking creation returns a minimal booking reference plus a high-entropy, narrowly scoped payment capability; store only its hash server-side. Require it for order/status calls, expire/rotate it, rate-limit and apply anti-abuse checks. A booking UUID or customer-supplied email alone must not authorize payment access or reveal learner details. Do not expose anonymous SELECT access to bookings.
- **Order creation:** validate the target record and entitlement, then obtain the amount from the server: ₹2,000 from the protected partner deposit, or a staff-approved exact learner quote/advance. Never accept the browser amount, course price text or callback as authoritative. Retain price ranges; wait for a quote rather than charging an invented price.
- Reserve one local attempt atomically, reuse an existing payable order, reject already-paid targets, and create the Razorpay order server-side. Record its ID before launching checkout. Reconcile provider-create timeouts by local attempt/receipt before creating another order; do not assume Orders API supplies idempotency automatically.
- Load checkout once with a bounded script-load failure state. Pass only the public key ID and server-issued order details. Handle failed payment, modal dismissal, app return, offline state and expired order explicitly. Preserve the booking/application and provide retry/check-status; dismissal must not override a payment later captured.
- **Callback verification:** send order/payment/signature values to the server. Verify HMAC-SHA256 of the stored `order_id + "|" + payment_id` using the API secret, then fetch provider payment/order data and check identity, amount, INR and captured status. An authorized-but-uncaptured payment remains pending. Frontend callbacks only request verification; they never write `Paid` or `Verified`.
- **Webhook:** add `src/routes/api/public/payments/razorpay-webhook.ts`. Verify `X-Razorpay-Signature` against the exact raw request body using a separate webhook secret before parsing or privileged writes. Deduplicate `x-razorpay-event-id`; match order/payment/amount/currency; process captured/paid, failure and refund events using one atomic, restricted database transition shared with callback verification. Handle duplicate and out-of-order events without downgrading captured payments. Acknowledge only after durable processing; return retryable errors on persistence failure. [2](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/best-practices/) [3](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/validate-test) [4](https://razorpay.com/docs/webhooks/faqs/)
- Authorize a narrowly scoped service-role payment transition compatible with the existing partner protection trigger. No client-callable privilege bypass. Verified capture can set partner payment `Verified` and application `Payment Received`, but must never approve a vehicle or documents. Preserve advanced application states rather than regressing them on late events.
- Sum captured payments by purpose for learner collection/balance; handle partial refunds accurately. Keep gateway financial evidence separate from auditable staff-verified manual receipts. Update admin labels to show provider/order/payment/reference details rather than always “No online charge”. Never store card numbers, CVV or UPI PINs.
- Provide bounded status checks and a reconciliation path when callback/webhook delivery is delayed. Logs exclude secrets, bank account numbers and raw sensitive payloads. Existing stored partner bank information should remain private; gateway collection does not require collecting new card or bank credentials.

## Owner actions / credentials required

1. Create or activate a Razorpay merchant account; complete business/KYC and settlement-bank verification, and confirm partner enrollment collection is permitted for your account.
2. When integration is approved, add `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` in **Project Settings → Secrets**, first for Test mode. Never paste the secret in chat or code. The key ID may be returned to checkout; the key secret must remain server-only.
3. After the webhook endpoint is implemented and you approve publishing it, configure its public HTTPS URL in Razorpay. Set one strong webhook secret there and the same `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in Project Settings → Secrets. Configure captured/paid, failure and refund events, plus an alert email. No endpoint has been deployed during this inspection.
4. Supply the learner charging rule: exact staff-approved fees/advance versus a fixed advance. **Default plan: staff-approved quote**, because prices are ranges and no fixed learner advance was supplied. Confirm partner ₹2,000 collection and legally reviewed cancellation/refund terms.
5. After testing, provide Live-mode keys and webhook configuration, enable approved payment methods/automatic capture, and authorize publishing. Razorpay activation, transaction fees and settlement eligibility remain provider-controlled.
6. If keeping manual partner payments as a fallback, supply/authorize the actual partner recipient separately. No additional Lovable Cloud database credentials are needed.

## Verification before release

- Reproduce the actual partner hang while signed in as the affected account; identify the precise stalled request, response and application/file state. Use test records only with permission.
- Customer: UPI reveal, desktop QR, Android/iOS app return, missing payment app, invalid amount, quote not ready, repeat submit and reload. Confirm one booking and the same authorized payment target.
- Partner: six required files, optional files, 10 MB boundary, disallowed formats, slow/interrupted upload, expired session, partial metadata failure, replacement and retry/reload. Confirm one resumable application and private files belonging to it.
- Razorpay Test mode: capture, authorization without capture, decline, dismissal, retry, script failure and order-create timeout; verify amount/identity tampering and access to another person's target are rejected.
- Security/reliability: forged callback and webhook signatures, duplicate/out-of-order events, callback/webhook races, missing callback, delayed webhook, database failure, reconciliation, full/partial refund. Confirm repeated events do not double-credit.
- Read results back in customer payment status, partner dashboard and staff payments. Payment capture must not bypass partner document/vehicle approval or promise a confirmed lesson slot.
- Check published HTTPS webhook delivery and mobile checkout, then a small owner-authorized Live payment and settlement/refund reconciliation. No real charge during diagnosis.

**Deliverable after approval:** preserve the UI, fix misleading/loading states first, then add gateway collection behind configuration readiness; existing manual records and staff verification remain intact.
